<h3>Part 1</h3>
Write a function named &#39; getmonitor&#39; that takes three arguments:
<br>
&#39; id&#39; , &#39; directory&#39; , and &#39; summarize&#39; .
<br>Given a monitor ID number, &#39; getmonitor&#39;
<p>reads that monitor&#39;s particulate matter data from the directory specified in the &#39; directory&#39;
    argument and returns a data frame containing that monitor&#39; s data.

<p>If &#39;summarize = TRUE&#39; , then &#39; getmonitor&#39; produces a summary of the data frame with the &#39;
    summary&#39; function and prints it to the console.

<p>A prototype of the function is as follows
    <code>
        getmonitor <- function(id, directory, summarize = FALSE) {
        ## &#39; id&#39; is a vector of length 1 indicating the monitor ID
        ## number. The user can specify &#39; id&#39; as either an integer, a
        ## character, or a numeric.

        ## &#39; directory &#39; is a character vector of length 1 indicating
        ## the location of the CSV files

        ## &#39; summarize &#39; is a logical indicating whether a summary of
        ## the data should be printed to the console; the default is
        ## FALSE

        ## Your code here
        }
    </code>

<p>
    You can see some example output from this function. The function that you write should be able to match this output.
    Please save your code to a file named getmonitor.R. To run the test script for this part, make sure your working
    directory has the file getmonitor.R in it and the run
    <code>
        <p>
            source( &quot; http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/compdata/scripts/getmonitor-test.R &quot; )
         </p>

            <br>
            getmonitor.testscript()

    </code>
<p>
    Afterwards, upload the output files on the Assignments List page.

<h3>Part 2</h3>
Write a function that reads a directory full of files and reports the number of completely observed cases in each data
file. The function should return a data frame where the first column is the name of the file and the second column is
the number of complete cases. A prototype of this function follows

complete <- function(directory, id = 1:332) {
## &#39; directory&#39; is a character vector of length 1 indicating
## the location of the CSV files

## &#39; id&#39; is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID numbers
## to be used

## Return a data frame of the form:
## id nobs
## 1 117
## 2 1041
## ...
## where &#39; id&#39; is the monitor ID number and &#39; nobs&#39; is the
## number of complete cases
}
 <p>
You can see some example output from this function. The function that you write should be able to match this output.
Please save your code to a file named complete.R. To run the test script for this part, make sure your working directory
has the file complete.R in it and the run
<code>
source( &quot; http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/compdata/scripts/complete-test.R &quot; )
    <br>
complete.testscript()
</code>
     <p>
Afterwards, upload the output files on the Assignments List page.
<h3>Part 3</h3>
Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation
between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is
greater than the threshold. The function should return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold
requirement. If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a numeric vector of length
0. A prototype of this function follows
<code>
corr <- function(directory, threshold = 0) {
## &#39; directory&#39; is a character vector of length 1 indicating
## the location of the CSV files

## &#39; threshold&#39; is a numeric vector of length 1 indicating the
## number of completely observed observations (on all
## variables) required to compute the correlation between
## nitrate and sulfate; the default is 0

## Return a numeric vector of correlations
}
</code>
<p>
For this function you will need to use the &#39; cor&#39; function in R which calculates the correlation between two
vectors. Please read the help page for this function via &#39; ?cor&#39; and make sure that you know how to use it.
<p>
You can see some example output from this function. The function that you write should be able to match this output.
Please save your code to a file named corr.R. To run the test script for this part, make sure your working directory has
the file corr.R in it and the run
<code>
source( &quot; http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/compdata/scripts/corr-test.R &quot; )
    <br>
corr.testscript()
</code>
    <p>
Afterwards, upload the output files on the Assignments List page.
Grading
    <p>
This assignment will be graded using unit tests executed via the test scripts you run on your computer. We will compare
the output of your functions to the correct output. For each test passed you receive the specified number of points on
the Assignments List web page. For each function in this assignment there will be 10 points to earn, for a total of 30
points for the entire assignment.
